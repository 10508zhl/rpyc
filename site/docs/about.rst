About
=====
RPyC was inspired by the work of **Eyal Lotem** on `pyinvoke <http://pybuild.sourceforge.net/pyinvoke.html>`_, which pioneered in the field of "dynamic RPC" (where there's no predefined contract between the two sides). The two projects, however, are completely unrelated in any other way. RPyC is developed and maintained by `Tomer Filiba <http://tomerfiliba.com>` (``tomerfiliba`` at ``gmail`` dot ``com``).

The logo is derived from the `Python logo <http://www.python.org/community/logos/>`_, with explicit permission. I created it using *Power Point*, and all the files are made available here:
