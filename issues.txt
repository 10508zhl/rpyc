=== Known Issues ===

* __cmp__ - comparing remote and local objects will usually not work, but 
  there's nothing to do about it. 

* 64bit platforms: since channels use 32bit length field, you can't pass 
  data/strings over 4gb. this is not a real limitation (unless you have a 
  superfast local network and tons of RAM), but as 64bit python becomes the
  defacto standard, i will upgrade channels to 64bit length field.

* threads: in face of no better solution, and after consulting many people,
  i resorted to setting a timeout on the underlying recv(). this is not an 
  elegant way, but all other solution required rewriting all sorts of 
  threading primitives and were not necessarily deadlock/race-free.
  as the zen says, "practicality beats purity".

* win32: pipes work like shit
